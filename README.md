## Introduction
Path planning is computatuonal problem to find a sequence of a valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. It is important in aviation engineering. Path planning can help consider suitable aircraft models, reduce flight time, and reduce flight costs. 

## Task1
Goal: Find the shortest route from departure point to the arrival point and determine the aircraft type for each scenario

The shortest path

Total Trip time required ->  102.50966799187796

### calculation

### Scenario 1
<li>3000 passengers need to travel within this week</li>
<li>12 flights maximum for one week</li>
<li>Time cost is medium and fuel cost is 0.76$/kg</li>

Result:
A330 is the best flight

### Scenario 2
<li>1250 passengers need to travel within this month</li>
<li>5 flight maximum for one week</li>
<li>Time cost is high and fuel cost is 0.88$/kg</li>

Result:
A350 is the best flight

### Scenario 3
<li>2500 passenger need to travel within this week</li>
<li>25 flights maximun for one week</li>
<li>time cost is low and fuel cost is 0.95$/kg</li>

Result:
A321 is the best flight

## Task2
Goal: recreate a jet stream that could benefit the flight route the most

Plan after adding a jet stream


## Task3
Goal:
